# Drug-sensitivity-prediction
User need to save input RNA-seq and target drug response files in the same folder. 

## **E_net.py** 

The code for elastic net regressor that takes gene expression as input, predict drug response in terms of AUC and finally gives the correlation coefficient between the predicted AUC and actual AUC as output. User needs to specify the path to the folder where the input and target files are saved at the beginning of the code to the variable **_path_**

Please send any email request to Dr. Taehyun Hwang (hwangt@ccf.org) to access the RNA-seq and drug response datasets.
